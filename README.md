# Traditions of the Scattered Path

The award-winning puzzle video game [Gorogoa](http://gorogoa.com/) had a
[limited collector
edition](https://www.iam8bit.com/collections/annapurna-interactive/products/gorogoa-nintendo-switch-physical-edition)
that came with a booklet, named "Traditions of the Scattered Path".
Little is known of this, except what the author said about it:
